# Hello-world
The beggining of data visualization. 
Geology major with a small MIS background. After not finding work in my field easily and with a exposure to BILLS and the working world, I feel that I would like to be a part of the data visualisation field. And perhaps contribute to the sciences with some programing in the future.
